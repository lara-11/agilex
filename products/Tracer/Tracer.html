  The TRACER high-speed shuttle AGV is a great solution for indoor autonomous
  logistics and warehousing applications. The two-wheel differential drive
  powered by two 150W brushless servo motors allows TRACER to carry a payload of
  100kg for 4 hours. TRACER's independent rocker arm independent suspension
  gives it the ability to traverse obstacles as tall as 10mm and slopes as steep
  as 8° with a minimum ground clearance of 30mm. With its ability to rotate in
  place, its low profile, and its steel body, TRACER is a great solution to your
  logistics platform needs.

<p class="tracer-info-2" style="text-align: justify;">
  The flat design of the body brings extreme bearing capacity. The two-wheel
  drive puts the universal wheels in motion, which can realize differential
  rotation and free shuttle in the indoor environment. It is additionally
  equipped with swing arm independent suspension which leads to easy surmounting
  of small obstacles.

      TRACER has unique advantages in the field of indoor transportation robots.
      Its compact and nimble structure enables it to freely navigate in
      cluttered and dynamic indoor environments. Its powerful motors and strong
      build allow TRACER to carry a large payload. Providing TRACER with a
      sensing and compute system allows it to operate autonomously. TRACER’s low
      cost, high efficiency, and ability to be deployed quickly allows it to
      perform excellently in indoor transportation scenarios.
